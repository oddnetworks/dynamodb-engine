But that means Doctor Doom is alive, too! How did they both survive? Hyperstorm has all the answers, but his incredible lineage means he may be the one foe the Fantastic Four can't beat. That's not the only problem Reed has - there's also the small matter of the Sub-Mariner's feelings for Sue! A rejuvenated Franklin completes the family reunion, but will a reassembled Fantastic Four have any room for Scott Lang, aka Ant-Man? The legendary band is back together, but their joy won't last for long. Onslaught is coming!
