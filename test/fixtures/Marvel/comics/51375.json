  "description": "Scott Lang has never exactly been the world's best super hero. Heck, most people don't even think he's been the best Ant-Man! And the last guy invented Ultron and joined the Masters of Evil, so that's saying something. But when the Superior Iron Man calls with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and an old enemy returns (sort of), Scott's going to get a chance to turn it all around and be the hero he's always dreamed of being. That's right, Ant-Man's starting a new life -a bold new adventure - and you know what that means! It means he needs to borrow some money. Sure he's been to prison! Sure he's been through a messy divorce! Sure he's been, um...dead. But this time is different! This time nothing is gonna stop the astonishing Ant-Man!",
