The worldwide Terrigenesis has thrown Black Bolt’s kingdom into chaos. Reed Richards transforms one of his greatest inventions to view the deaths of worlds.

Can any of them find the strength to press the button that destroys a world? There’s no turning back for the Illuminati, and they’ll pay the price for their sins.
