  "description": "For over thirty years, cartoonist Fred Hembeck has been poking fun at Marvel's mightiest heroes. Now, some of his greatest works are collected in a giant-sized one-shot that's bursting with belly laughs! Fred relentlessly roasts the Fantastic Four with the help of an all-star cast of artists! Fred wipes out the Marvel Universe in the tale they said couldn't be published (and almost wasn't)! Even Spider-Man and the Hulk are no match for Hembeck's trademark wit! Plus: a cornucopia of side-splitting short strips from the pages of Marvel Age - and an all-new introduction by the man himself! Collecting FANTASTIC FOUR ROAST, FRED HEMBECK DESTROYS THE MARVEL UNIVERSE and AMAZING SPIDER-MAN DIGITAL COMIC #16 - and material from HULK ANNUAL '99; and MARVEL AGE #50, #52, #54-55, #69, #97, #122-123 and #130-131.",
