So naturally he recruits four other versions of himself! What could go wrong? Lady Deadpool, Kid Deadpool, Dogpool, Headpool and the original Merc With a Mouth form...the Deadpool Corps! The consciousness-sapping Awareness has wiped out the free will of millions of planets, and the Corps must stop it from destroying the galaxy! If they can keep the infighting and binge drinking to a minimum, they just might just stand a chance. Then, the Omega Confederation hires the Corps to stop a rebellion. But when Deadpool falls for Princess Teela, the group promptly switches sides - and incites a civil war! Will their meddling destroy an entire planet? Collecting PRELUDE TO DEADPOOL CORPS #1-5, DEADPOOL CORPS #1-12 and DEADPOOL FAMILY #1. ",
