The Faustians have made their deal with the Devil -- er, Enchantress -- but Angela isn't going to take that lying down, is she? No, not by her psychic ribbons and very, very pointy weapons, no, she is not.\n- Out into the wilds of the countryside, Angela and Sera collide with a wandering caravan of ne'er-do-well performers. (Hint: their name starts with a \"G\" and ends with an \"Y\" and has an \"Uardians of the Galax\" in the middle.)\n- Pagan rites, dubious ethics, a deadly curse, and Kieron and Irene Koh being up to no good â€\" who can resist the lure of the Faustians?\n",
