  "description": "Squirrel Girl has woken up, only to find she’s been hurled back in time to the 1960s! Mondays, am I right? And if that wasn’t trouble enough, her friend Nancy is coming face to face with the villainous [CENSORED]! Yes, I’ve noticed that when I type [CENSORED]’s name it shows up as [CENSORED]; no, I don’t know how to fix that. This book features the following: Squirrel Girl, time travel, [CENSORED], and emotions! It promises to satisfy fans of each of those things, even if they don’t like the other things! Which is great because emotions are just THE WORST.",
