  "description": "Elsa Bloodstone is stationed on the Wall, tasked with keeping Battleworld’s zombie hordes contained. Elsa thinks often of her deceased father, Ulysses Bloodstone — how all his lessons gave her the skills to fight, but the love he didn’t give is indirectly what landed her on the Wall to begin with. When Elsa spots a human child caught in the zombieverse, she decides to rescue the girl — and now, stranded in the Deadlands with this mysterious child and stalked by a merciless hunter, Elsa must traverse the zombie-ridden landscape and escape. But haunted by ghosts from her past — including visions of her stern father — Elsa realizes it may not be the zombies she fears. And she’s about to learn that the child is not what she claims to be. Collecting MARVEL ZOMBIES (2015) #1-4 and MARVEL ZOMBIES (2006) #1.",
