  "description": "Remember those Skrulls that Reed Richards brainwashed into living out their lives as cows? Good thing nobody ever slaughtered those cattle for beef, right? Uh-oh.

And when the Skrulls launch their Secret Invasion, the Krew's bloody mission becomes more important than ever - but what happens when one of them starts to sympathize with their victims? Collecting SKRULL KILL KREW (1995) #1-5, AVENGERS: THE INITIATIVE #16-19, SKRULL KILL KREW (2009) #1-5 and material from DARK REIGN: NEW NATION #1. ",
