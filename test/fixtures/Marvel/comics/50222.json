  "description": "Rocket Raccoon is the last of his kind: a hero to the weak, a champion of\ngood, a swashbuckling pioneer of valor (and guns). But his life of\nadventure may end abruptly when he’s framed for murder — and the\nauthorities aren’t the only ones on his tail! (Get it?) There’s another\n“Rocket Raccoon” out there, but the universe just ain’t big enough! The\nlookalike killer is one step ahead of Rocket; now, it’s up to our hero and\nhis best pal, Groot, to find the truth! With Macho Gomez and the\nEx-Terminators tracking him, can Rocket make it out alive and clear his\nname? Superstar creator Skottie Young delivers the series we’ve been\nwaiting decades for. Because really, Rocket and Groot are the only\nGuardians of the Galaxy you actually care about, right? Collecting ROCKET\nRACCOON (2014) #1-6.\n",
