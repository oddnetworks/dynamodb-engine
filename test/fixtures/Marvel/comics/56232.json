  "description": "Terrible acts committed by mutant revolutionary Cyclops have placed mutantkind in extinction’s crosshairs…and no one is left to suffer the consequences more than his time-displaced counterpart—teen-aged Scott Summers. As Storm and her team whisk Earth’s remaining mutants away to safe haven, the original X-Men do just the opposite: emboldened by super heroic ideals, the ALL-NEW X-MEN set out on the road to save their world and write their own futures. But can youthful optimism reverse the damage Cyclops has done?",
