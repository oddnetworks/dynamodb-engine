Their happily ever after might actually last forever - unless someone comes between them. Someone like Arthur Keaton: Vampire Hunter, who also happens to be Denise's brother! Then there's the demonic Lilith, who's long had designs on Oscar. She'll go to great lengths to seduce him, in a bid to usher the world into a new age of wanton lust. Can true love conquer all, even for the undead? Rediscover a forgotten tale of fangs, family and infatuation! Collecting MARVEL GRAPHIC NOVEL #20 and material from BIZARRE ADVENTURES #29.",
