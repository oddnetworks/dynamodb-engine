  "description": "US Army General Thunderbolt Ross used to a be a huge pain in Hulk's you know what! But as the saying goes, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em! He decided to supersize himself and join the team as Red! Just as cranky as before, Red still gives Hulk a hard time, but deep down he loves being a part of the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. - that, and his Gatling Laser Cannon. ",
